### Hey, Iâ€™m Ahmed Sadeq!

My dream is to be a software engineer, I love Linux and cats and I'm currently based in Germany.

About me:
- I'm presently working on diverse projects to improve my profile.
- My favourite programming languages, in no particular order, are C++, Rust, Python and TypeScript.
- I spend a tremendous time on my computer playing video games. Some of my favourite games are The Witcher 3 and Grand Theft Auto V.
